# Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)

Think of Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) in the larger Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystem.  RaaS allows less experienced adversaries to carry out attacks.

While phishing is still used, drive-by download, VPN vulnerabilities and distribution over [botnets](botnets.md) are more likely used.

For workstations (Windows, macOS, *nix), a ransomware infection means that data on the device has been encrypted or the operating system is being blocked, and its owner receives a message to pay a ransom. Mobile ransomware (Android, iOS) variants can also encrypt, but most use other techniques.

While individuals, companies, and NGOs are all targets, the compromise of a small number of user accounts that have additional access or privileges, are especially valuable to [adversaries](adversaries.md). A ransomware attack can mean the loss of data, spending large sums of money, or both.

## We do it for \[insert reasons here\]

RansomedVC published the data of nine victims on its leak site in August 2023. The group has adopted the ideology of many other ransomware actors: "We are doing it for pentesting", and humorously adds that any vulnerabilities found must also be reported to Europeâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), threatening victims with data breach fines if the ransom is not paid.

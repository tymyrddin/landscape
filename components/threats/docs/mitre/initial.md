# Initial access shifts

There is a shift in Mitre Att&Ck techniques used by attackers. [Phishing for information](phishing.md) has apparently been replaced by [Drive-by downloads](drive-by.md) as favourited initial access technique.

In a nutshell, at the moment (December 2023):

* Ransomware attacks continue their prominence, are becoming more aggressive, more blatant and more costly; 
* followed closely by supply chain attacks;
* and mobile and IoT devices and applications can lack in security, and become easy points of entry for adversaries.

# Stalkerware

[Spyware](spyware.md) and stalkerware are similar, yet not the same. Both are types of malware used to track a personâ€™s activity on a device. But stalkerware is a more personal way of invading another person's privacy. Stalkerware has to be physically installed, meaning that the attacker has to have direct access to the devices they are trying to compromise. Stalkerware is most likely used by a parent or partner. 

Stalkerware is less likely to masquerade as something else entirely. Not always. In some cases it claims to be a child protection app, featuring disguise, in which case it is clear it is used to spy on a partner without him/her knowing. Even without, when intended to track children's activities, its intent is always considered malicious, as it invades privacy. 

With stalkerware installed on another person's device, the adversary can activate the camera or microphone, view login details to different accounts, and sometimes even intercept phone calls.

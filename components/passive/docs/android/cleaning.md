# Detecting and removing Android malware

Phones contain more sensitive information than PC's and Workstations. It usually contains pictures, credit cards, private messages, and other valuable data for adversaries.

***If you think it will turn into a "legal issue", DO NOT shut the device down or try to remove the malware, and call in a first responder instead.***

## Detecting malware

* If the symptoms appeared immediately after installing an app, that app may be the guilty party.
* If you get ads in the notification bar, then long tap those and then touch on ***All Categories*** to learn which app is displaying the ads.
* Go to ***Settings -> Battery and monitor usage***. If you recently charged, Battery usage data is not available. Wait a few hours for the data to become available.
* Go to ***Settings -> Network & Internet -> Data usage -> Mobile data usage / Wi-Fi data usage***.

## Removing malware

* Go to ***Settings*** and tap on ***Apps (& Notifications)***.
* Locate the app.
* Tap on it, and choose ***Uninstall***.

If the ***Uninstall*** option is greyed out or not there at all, then it means that the app has gained privileges.

## Removing admin rights

* Go to ***Settings -> Security & location -> Device admin apps***.
* Tap on the checkbox and then tap on ***Deactivate this device admin app***.
* Go back to the ***Apps & notifications*** to remove it.

## Fail

* If removing admin rights did not work, do a [Factory reset](https://support.google.com/android/answer/6088915?hl=en)
* If a factory reset does not work, it is probably a very persistent malware (like xHelper), and you may wish to analyse it further and/or get help doing so.

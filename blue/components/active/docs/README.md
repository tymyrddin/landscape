# Active defence

Adding active defence we can perhaps slow down adversaries and make hacking our devices and (small) networks more difficult and costly. 

* Honeypots or honeynets can be used to attract attackers, record the actions of adversaries, and alert administrators of breaches. 
* Honeyclients mimic the behaviour of a user-driven network client application, such as a web browser or chat app, while getting attribution on the adversary.
* Honeyports create a fake listening port on an external facing real but non-important server that are favourite port for remote attacks, like telnet or ssh.

Which one to choose and why? Learning from the [inquiry-based choices made by security people in corporations](design/README.md), and the development roadmaps of honeypots, we can make [active defence design choices for @home and @NGO contexts](small/README.md).

# Marketplaces

There seems to have been a move from the Darkweb to Telegram, probably due to increased pressure from law enforcement and other threat actors.

Darkweb is still on though, with sites like InTheBox, a marketplace for mobile malware, 2Easy, where threat actors buy and sell harvested data, and Russian Market (despite the name it is english), where you can buy stolen credit cards, credentials, or cookies, and buy access to specific remote desktop protocol clients/servers.

# Vishing

Vishing is a type of phishing that uses phone, robocall, voicemail, voice over internet protocol (VoIP), and social engineering to contact you in an attempt to gather personal information about you.

## Robocalls

A robocall is an automated telephone call that delivers a pre-recorded message. Organisations, telemarketers, and adversaries use robocalls to reach millions of phones every single day. They make people's phones ring with natural-sounding recorded voices and offer everything from auto warranties to games. In some cases it can even issue a threat to get your attention. Some robocalls can even respond to your questions. 

Robocalls are made using auto-dialing software, and may use caller ID spoofing technology to make it seem as if the phone call is coming from someone else.

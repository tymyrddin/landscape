# Spyware

Spyware infects a device via the installation of [a malicious app that has disguised itself as harmless](squatting.md). This means you could unknowingly infect your device with malware by downloading a malicious file from the web. Spyware can be spread to a device via [pishing](../mitre/phishing.md), smishing, and vishing.

Spyware is designed to track activity on whatever device, or devices, it is installed on: websites visited, contacts, applications used, and login details for various online accounts, meaning payment details, social media logins, sensitive files, and other confidential data become vulnerable.

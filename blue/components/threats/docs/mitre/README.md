# Introduction

The Mitre Att&Ck framework describes cyberattacks from attacker perspectives, and can be used for analysing the current threat landscape.

We can map our defensive capabilities against the Mitre Att&Ck framework, and overlay this map with [potential threats to our devices and (home) networks](../backdrop/README.md) for discovering where and how best to invest our time and energy. The gaps discovered are the areas to focus on first.

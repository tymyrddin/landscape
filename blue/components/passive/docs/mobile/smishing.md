# Detecting and preventing smishing

## Detection

* The message offers quick money from winning prizes or collecting cash after entering information. Coupon code offerings are also popular.
* Financial institutions and government agencies will never send a text asking for credentials or a money transfer.
* A sender number with only a few digits probably came from an email address, a sign of spam.

## Prevention

* Avoid responding to a phone number that you do not recognise.
* Never send credit card numbers, ATM PINs, or banking information to someone via text messages. Or on the phone, over email, ...
* If a text claims to be from a specific organisation or individual, contact that entity directly using known contact information, not the details provided in the text.
* Many smartphones and carriers now provide SMS filtering options to identify and block or flag suspicious texts.
* Some security applications for mobile devices can help identify phishing links in text messages and prevent users from accessing malicious sites.
* Even if attackers obtain some credentials through smishing, using Multifactor Authentication is an additional protective layer.
* Do not store banking information on a mobile device. 
* Have two phone numbers, one for bureacratic matters and one for personal other use.
* Telecoms offer numbers to report attacks. To protect other users, report it so that it can be investigated. 
* Be aware of current smishing tactics and threats. Awareness is the first line of defense.
